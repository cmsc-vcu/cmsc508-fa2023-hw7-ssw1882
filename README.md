# Databases, DDLs, and Digitalia, Oh my!

Here we use a DDL to build a database that lists employees along with their respective skills and roles. Everything can be found in the hw7 folder. 

# Known Issues: 

I don't know how to get the flipping crow's foot diagram to render inside quarto, it renders just fine in its out mmd file! 

I'm getting points off on gradescope for the way I solved the question where Person 4 has no skills and needs to be referenced. Dunno how else to fix that other than what I did, but I'm curious to know.
